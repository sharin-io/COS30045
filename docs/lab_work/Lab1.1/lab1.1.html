    <h1>Title of Article about pet ownership during the COVID Pandemic</h1>
    <h2>Author: Shin Thant Thi Ri </h2>

    <!-- Paragraph -->
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic not only reshaped daily life but also significantly influenced pet ownership trends in
        Australia. As more people spent time at home, the desire for companionship led to a noticeable increase in
        pet
        ownership across various types, particularly <strong><em>dogs</em></strong> and
        <strong><em>cats</em></strong>.
        This shift is
        clearly reflected in the data, which
        shows a rise in the percentage of households with pets, as well as an overall increase in the total pet
        population. Many found comfort in their new furry friends, creating bonds that became <strong>a source of
            emotional
            support</strong> during the pandemic. The trend also highlights the growing importance of pets in
        Australian
        households,
        not just as animals but as integral members of the family. This article explores how the pandemic fueled
        this
        surge in pet ownership, the benefits and challenges that came with it, and the lasting impact on Australian
        households.

    <p>
        With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to consider the needs of companion
        animals and their owners when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as
        accepting
        animals in public places and transport.
