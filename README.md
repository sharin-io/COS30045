# COS30045 - Data Visualisation
Welcome to the repository for COS30045 - Data Visualisation. This course explores the foundational principles of information visualization and good design practices. Throughout this unit, we will delve into the various types of information graphics and visual representations, learning how to effectively communicate data through visual means.

## Course Overview

### Topics Covered:
- **Introduction to Data Visualisation**: Understanding the importance and role of visualizing data.
- **Brief History of Data Visualisation**: Exploring the evolution and milestones in data visualization.
- **Data Visualisation Design Guidelines, Graphical Integrity**: Learning the best practices and ethical considerations in designing visualizations.
- **Visual Variables: Marks and Channels**: Examining the building blocks of visual representations.
- **Visualisation Critique**: Developing skills to evaluate and improve visualizations.
- **Analysis of User Tasks in Visualisation Usage**: Understanding user interactions and tasks in the context of visual data.
- **Data Sets and Types**: Identifying different data types and how they influence visualization techniques.
- **Interaction: Manipulating View, Filtering**: Learning how to enhance user experience with interactive visualizations.
- **Arranging Tables, Graphs, and Maps**: Effective layout strategies for various types of data presentations.
- **Colour Theory**: Exploring the use of color in visual communication.
- **Human Perception and Cognition**: Understanding how humans perceive and interpret visual data.
- **User Research**: Conducting research to inform visualization design choices.
- **Introduction to Data-Driven Documents (D3)**: Learning the basics of D3.js for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
